This plugin provides a shortcode that allows to print a full inventory of WooCommerce products, variants included, on a single frontend page.

== Description ==

Do you want to provide some users a **full inventory** of your WooCommerce installation without giving them full-rights on your Wordpress?

This plugin allows you to publish a full inventory on a frontend page with a simple shortcode. Every registerd user (even subscribers) will be able to view it. Not registered users will get a customizable error message.

**Please note** this is an early stage version of the plugin and it is very limited at the moment. It just prints the inventory in a page inside the template you are using (it might actually conflict with it for a couple of styles I hardcoded into the file).

Do you want to raise a bug, propose a change, request for support or simply congratulate me? The [Official Page][http://www.mirkogrewing.eu/woocommerce-frontend-inventory/ "Official Page of the Plugin"] is waiting for your voice!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin's folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `[woofi]` in any page to show the inventory.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Is there anything I can configure? =

Just the error message. But hey... that's something! :P

= It messed up with my template, what I can do? =

You are unlucky. The plugin uses a simple table and a couple of minimal styles. Unless you edit the styles directly in the plugin, you may want to wait for further releases: customizable styles are on the roadmap...

= Hey, most of the visitors get an error message! =

Only registered users can see that page. You can modify the error message in the settings.
