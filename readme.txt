This plugin provides a shortcode that allows to print in a front-end page a full inventory of products listed in WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Do you want to provide some users a **full inventory** of your WooCommerce without giving them access to the WooCommerce configuration area in the Dashboard?

This plugin allows you to publish a full inventory in a frontend page with a simple shortcode. Not registered users will get an error message.

**Please note** this is an early stage version of the plugin and it won't offer any configurable setting or option. It just print the inventory in a page inside the template you are using (it might actually conflict with it for a couple of styles I hardcoded into the file).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin's folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `[woofi]` in any page to show the inventory.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Is there anything I can configure? =

Not just yet.

= It messes up with my template, what I can do? =

You are unlucky. The plugin uses a table and a couple of minimal styles. You may want to wait for further releases: customization settings are on the roadmap...

= Hey, most of the visitors get an error message! =

Only registered users can see that page. And yes, I will add an option for that eventually... :)
