== Description ==

What is WooCommerce Frontend Inventory for?

Do you want to provide some users with a **full inventory** of your WooCommerce installation without giving them access to the WooCommerce configuration area in the Dashboard?  

This plugin allows you to publish a full inventory on a frontend page with a simple shortcode. **Every registerd user** will be able to view it, while unregistered users will get an error message.

Special thanks to [Mike Jolley](http://profiles.wordpress.org/mikejolley/) who provided the [initial script](https://t.co/CtLxf1XCVN).

**Please note** this is an early stage version of the plugin and it is very limited at the moment. It just prints the inventory in a page and it might actually conflict with the theme you are using because of some styles hard-coded into the plugin.
